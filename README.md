###Description:
This Ruby program will return the degrees between the hour and minute hand for any given time entry, for a 12-Hour clock format.

###Directions:
To use this program, Ruby with `irb` must be installed on your system.

Download Clock Angle repository zip file using `Download Zip` button from (https://github.com/gpepic/clock_angle_rb).

Copy file to `directory` of your choice.  From your command line, in the same directory, enter the following:

```ruby
$ irb
irb:> require '.lib/clock_angle.rb'
irb:> clock_angle
```

Program will ask you to enter time.  Use `HH:MM 12-Hour format`, such as `8:23`.  It will return the `degrees` between the hour hand and minute hand.

Remember to quit `irb` using `exit` or `quit`.  If `irb` hangs, use `ctrl+C` a couple of times and then enter `quit` or close your terminal and re-open.

Enjoy!
